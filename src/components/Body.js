          <p>
            My name is David. I am a student (at the moment of creation of this
            website) at the Georgian College, my major is - Computer
            Programming. I'm a type of a programmer who is always learning
            something new, even in my leisure I spend the time creating
            different projects using different programming languages. In my
            career I was working with a whole list of technologies and
            platforms: OO programming languages -{'  '}
            <span>Python </span>(Scripting)<span>,C# and Java üß° </span>&& Web
            development -{' '}
            <span>
              JS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript frameworks such as ReactJS üòç{' '}
            </span>{' '}
            (P.S this website was built using React JS and React Icons only)
            <span>, JQuery, ThreeJS, and Django üêç</span> (have some projects on
            my gitHub account)&& I have also challenged myself in learning more
            about mobile development -{' '}
            <span>React Native, Android Studio (Java, not Kotlin)</span> &&
            Recently, put some effort to learn more about Cloud systems ‚òÅÔ∏è,
            particularly{' '}
            <span>AWS (EC2, Lambda functions, S3 bucket, API Gateway) </span>and
            <span> Google Cloud Platform </span>. && Most of the spring 2022
            spent on learning <span>Python scripting (Windows and Linux)</span>.
            And many more, but as I said time is money

          <p>
            As I have already said, I am a project guy and I have some projects
            uploaded on my github account (not all of them are there, but recent
            only). I'm always trying to learn something new and grow as the
            developer, and almost all my projects were created by me and me only
            this is why some day I wish to try myself as a part of the team of
            developers. Nowadays, I'm learning new JS framework ThreeJS and
            there is no way I could miss an opportunity to create one more
            project. Here it is by the way....

                Yeah, I know how it sounds, but here it is - Duck market. As I
                have already mentioned before, right now I'm learning more about
                new JS framework called ThreeJS and this project is the way I
                learn more about implementation of the 3D into the web. The
                website is still in the stage of the production (I'm sorry but
                you can't really buy a duck), but it has almost all the
                front-end features. The website is based on the ReactJS (states
                are managed by Context API and useReducer hook), ReactJS
                Bootstrap, and as I said ThreeJS. <br /> I also have a few more
                projects, but they are all collecting dust on the shelevs of the
                github

          <p>
            Congratulations, you made all the way through and here is a little
            conclusion. I know this website may look a bit like it was made only
            in a few days (in fact it was), but I need to focus more on classes
            in the college, this is why I don't have much time, but I promise I
            wll make it better üôè.
